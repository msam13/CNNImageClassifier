# CNNImageClassifier
The MODULE - 0 of Computer Vision

**Overview:** Developed a PyTorch-based image classification project to accurately categorize images into predefined classes, demonstrating proficiency in deep learning and computer vision.


**Technical Approach:** Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multiple convolutional and fully connected layers, utilizing ReLU activation, max pooling, and backpropagation for training, while leveraging the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer and cross-entropy loss for efficient learning.
